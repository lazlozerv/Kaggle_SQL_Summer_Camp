A frequent question is \" How can I train my ML model if my dataset is too big to fit on my computer? \" \n","Of course you can subsample your dataset, but you can also use tools like BQML that train your model directly in your database.\n","\n","* __You don't have to use multiple languages__. If someone doesn't know your preferred language for modeling, working in SQL can make it easier for you to collaborate.\n","\n","* __You can serve your model immediately after it's trained__. Because your model is already in the same place as your data, you can make predictions directly from your database. That way you don't have to clean your code.\n","\n","\n","BQML probably won't replace your modelling tools, but it's a nice quick way to train and serve a model without spending a lot of time moving code or data around."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4htguwntUkav","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#### Models supported by BQML\n","\n","* Linear regression (LINEAR_REG).
